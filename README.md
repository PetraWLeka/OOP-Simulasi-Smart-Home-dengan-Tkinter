# OOP-Simulation-Smart-Home-with-Tkinter

This OOP project using Python with the **Tkinter** module and **SQLite3** aims to simulate an interactive and customizable smart home system. In this project, users can control various electronic devices and monitor home environmental conditions in real-time through an intuitive graphical interface. Device data and user settings are stored and managed using the **SQLite** database, allowing efficient storage and easy information management. By using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, this project can be easily developed to add new features or expand its functionality according to user needs.
